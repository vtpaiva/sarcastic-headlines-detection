## Installing requirements

In order to be able to run the *Jupyter* notebooks to enhance the code **reproducibility**, it is necessary to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Modeling Approaches

1. **Word Frequency and Word Count Analysis**
   - Utilize the difference in word frequency between the target classes.
   - Incorporate the word count of each headline as a feature for prediction.

2. **Neural Network with Word Embeddings**
   - Employ a word embedding method with `Keras` to extract patterns in the data.
   - Leverage neural network architectures to capture semantic relationships between words.

---

## Objectives

- Develop models capable of accurately identifying sarcasm in headlines.
- Compare and evaluate the performance of traditional feature engineering techniques against deep learning methods.
